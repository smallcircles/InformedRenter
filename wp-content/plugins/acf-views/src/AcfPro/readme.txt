This folder contains the Repeater & Clone features from the 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin (version 6.2.1).
These features are required by the 'ACF Views' UI, enabling the use of 'ACF Views' with the standard
'Advanced Custom Fields' (non-PRO) plugin.

The files are executed only if there is no active 'ACF PRO' plugin installed.
The 'acf_add_options_page' function of the options page feature have been removed, preventing users from calling it.
The 'ACF' plugin is released under the 'GPLv2 or later' license
(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), ensuring that no rights are violated.

Repeater & Clone fields are marked as private (identified with '_custom' in PHP),
and they only work in 'back compatibility' mode.
 Adding new fields with these types by the user is not possible.

The 'Gutenberg block' feature is exclusively available with the 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin.

We highly recommend using the 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin.
