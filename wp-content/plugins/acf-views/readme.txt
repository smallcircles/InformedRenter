Smart templates to display your content easily. Built-in post queries and automated template generation. Develop quickly, and maintain flexibility.

== Description ==

Smart templates to display your content easily. Built-in post queries and automated template generation. Develop quickly, and maintain flexibility.

Note: "ACF Views" plugin requires [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin to be enabled on your website (either Free or Pro version).

== üåü Display ACF fields and Posts ==

Solve all these scenarios quickly and easily.

* [Display ACF fields on a page](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-fields-on-a-single-page)
E.g. add multiple ACF fields to the homepage and display them

* [Display specific posts (built-in or CPT) in a grid or list beautifully](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-cards/basic/display-multiple-posts-and-their-fields)
E.g. display the latest WooCommerce products with their ACF fields

* [Display specific post or CPT item with its fields](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-custom-post-and-its-fields)
E.g. display "sponsor" CPT item on another post/page

* [Display specific ACF fields for all items of a CPT](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/display-fields-for-a-custom-post-type)
E.g. display multiple ACF fields for all WooCommerce products

Nearly all plugins use Custom Post Types (CPT) to store their data. Plugins like WooCommerce call it [Products](https://wplake.org/blog/woocommerce-product-page-template-with-acf-fields/), whatever they're called the ACF Views plugin supports it all.

== üïó Less time with less effort ==

Best approach, out of the box. Read about [the benefits](https://wplake.org/blog/display-acf-fields-beautifully-and-without-coding/).

* Select fields from a list, no need to worry about their names and return types
* Auto-generated Twig template with the BEM methodology for class names
* UI to define selection filters, no need to worry about DB query arguments
* Editing theme templates via FTP is in the past
* CSS and JS code can be added without hassle
* Built-in features, like pagination to save hours of coding

== üí° How it works ==

View for ACF fields
Create a View and assign one or more post fields, our plugin then generates a shortcode that you'll use to display the field values to users. Style the output with the CSS field included in every View.

Card for post selections
Create a Card and assign posts (or CPT items), choose a View (that will be used to display each item) and our plugin generates a shortcode that you‚Äôll use to display the set of posts. The list of posts can be assigned manually or dynamically with filters.

== üîß Customizable Twig templates ==

Unlimited control over the markup with customizable Twig templates and an [extensive set](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/twig-templates) of Twig features.

Work faster: copy and paste the generated template and change it in seconds!

== üìö Extensive Docs and Friendly Support ==

Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieu3Mk2Ah0A&list=PL4WYpE2DYvTyzk1DtNhXJ4BXRjtIndht3) showcases the use of our plugin and its features, making it easier for new users to get started. See our [Docs](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/acf-views-plugin-for-wordpress) for step by step guides and for information about customization.
Questions about the Basic ACF Views plugin are handled through the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/acf-views/). Customers with an active Pro license have personal support via our [support form](https://wplake.org/acf-views-support/).

Visit [our website](https://wplake.org/acf-views/) to get more information.

== üì¢ Powerful features ==

* Display built-in post fields (like title or featured image) along with ACF fields
* Display post A in post B with its fields
* Define custom CSS and JS
* No style conflicts due to BEM method used
* Combine ACF fields from two different field groups
* Restrict visibility to specific user roles

== üéØ High Performance ==

Every wrapper has some overhead. We do our best to make this number as small as possible. One unique ACF View/Card on a page would only effect this by 0.01 seconds**\*** overhead compared to the usual way with coding. It's impossible to notice these tiny numbers visually without testing it.
**\***More about the test [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/performance).

== Get more with Pro ==

= Custom fields not in the list of fields? =

Only fields created using the official Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin are compatible with ACF Views. See list above for supported field types.

= Can I display user fields? =

Yes, you set up your field groups in ACF and assign those fields to your View, paste the shortcode in the target place, add the object-id="$user$" argument to the shortcode to display the fields from the current user. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/shortcode) for more about shortcode arguments.

= Can I display fields from my options page? =

Yes, you set up your field groups in ACF and assign those fields to your View, paste the shortcode in the target place, add the object-id="options" argument to the shortcode to display the fields from the options page. See [here](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/shortcode) for more about shortcode arguments.

= Fields have been assigned but the page doesn't show them =

Have you checked that the fields are filled in the target object? See [steps](https://docs.acfviews.com/guides/acf-views/basic/creating-an-acf-view) for creating an ACF View.

= Can I display fields inside the Gutenberg Query Loop? =

You can use the View shortcode inside the Gutenberg Query Loop element. Please make sure you've added it via the built-in Shortcode block, as it won't work properly with other block types, like Code or Custom HTML.
